Dear professors,

It's a pleasure to meet you all!

My name is Lin Desong, and I graduated from Qufu Normal University with a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering.

I have lots of experience in coding and a deep passion for computer science. I often watch open courses online, such as CS50 by Harvard University, to further my knowledge in the field.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing the guitar and volleyball. I also listen to music when I'm feeling down.

This is my first time in Shanghai, and I know there are many opportunities here. I would like to dedicate all my life time to study computer science.

Given the chance, I would like to pursue my studies at Shanghai Normal University.

Thank you for your time.
